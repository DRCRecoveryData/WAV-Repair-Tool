This repair method fixes corrupted WAV files by replacing their damaged headers with a valid one from a reference WAV file. The process involves:

1. 🔍 **Finding Header Sections:** It extracts the "fmt " and "data" chunks from both the reference and corrupted files.
2. 🔧 **Reconstructing the Header:** If the corrupted file’s "fmt " section is valid, it uses it; otherwise, it takes it from the reference file.
3. 🛠️ **Rebuilding the Data Chunk:** It keeps the audio data from the corrupted file but ensures the "data" chunk header is correctly formatted.
4. 📏 **Updating RIFF Size:** It recalculates and updates the RIFF chunk size for file integrity.
5. 💾 **Saving the Fixed File:** The repaired file is saved with the original name inside a “Repaired” folder.

This approach keeps the original audio content while fixing header-related corruption. 🚀
