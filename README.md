![2024-04-18_080318](https://github.com/DRCRecoveryData/WAV-Repair-Tool/assets/85211068/90966cd3-0297-4c51-b2f4-7418afb0b3b4)


## Overview
The WAV Audio File Repair Tool is a program developed by DRC Recovery that repairs WAV audio files that have been corrupted by the Stop/DJVU Ransomware. The ransomware is known for encrypting a wide range of file types, including audio files, which can cause significant disruption and loss for those who rely on audio files for their work or personal projects. This tool can help to alleviate some of the damage caused by the ransomware by repairing the audio files and making them accessible once again.

## Usage
To use the tool, follow these steps:

1. Download the latest release of the WAV Audio File Repair Tool from the releases page.
2. Extract the contents of the archive to a directory on your computer.
3. Double-click the `main.py` file to run the program.
4. Enter the path of the reference wave file and the path of the directory containing the corrupted wave files when prompted.
5. Wait for the tool to repair the files. A progress bar will be displayed to show the status of the repair process.
6. The repaired files will be saved to a directory named "Repaired" within the directory containing the corrupted wave files.

**Note:** The tool only repairs the audio files and does not provide a solution for decrypting the files or removing the ransomware itself. Victims of the Stop/DJVU Ransomware should still take steps to remove the malware and recover their data in a safe and secure manner.
